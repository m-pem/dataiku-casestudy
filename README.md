# dataiku-casestudy

here we will perform some data analysis

# Reproduce results

To reproduce the results you will first need to download the datafiles from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PPsjCoM130k3n3V4roq-yF74jkPjkVd7)


Save them at the root of the project in a file called raw_data/

With the files downloaded you will then need to install the packages required to run this project.

It was created using python X

I reccomend using a virtual env (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for guidence) to manage your work space.

With the virtual env created, or not, you can install all the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirenents.txt

With the pakcages sucesfully installed you are now able to reproduce the results. 

Run script main.py to produce the output.

# Overview of project

## Problem Statement

For this technical assessment, you have been tasked with identifying characteristics that are
associated with a person making more or less than $50,000 per year; the target variable for
your research question is the final column of the datasets.

As the data scientist on this project, you are to attempt to answer this question by constructing a
data analysis/modeling pipeline. Code submissions should be in Python and making the solution
easily readable and replicable by the team will give you additional marks. In the event you would
like to use a different language or tool, please ask. Considerations for your data analysis should
include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Numerical and/or graphical representations of the data that
may help inform insights and/or tactics for answering the research question of interest.
- Data Preparation: Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, etc., that may aid
in improving data clarity & model generation.
-Data Modeling: The building of a few competing models to predict the target variable.
-Model Assessment: A selection of the best model based on performance comparisons.
-Results: A concise summary of key findings, recommendations, & future improvements.



# Problem statement
identifying characteristics that are associated with a person making more or less than $50,000 per year; the target variable for your research question is the final column of the datasets.

This for me feels very much like segmentation of people within these groups - but is it?

This is a study that looks to identify charachteristics for people in two distinct groups. Those making more than 50,000 per year, and those making less.

coach and support

The goal of my presentation is going to be to teach someone how they can use datascience or how someone in their team can use data science to actually generate these insights.

We're going to walk them through what we've done and the technuqies we've used to generate the insights we created at the end.

Presentation Guidelines

Data Scientists at Dataiku are customer facing. Our primary mission is to coach and support
our customers in the use of Data Science Studio and help them become proficient users. This
sometimes includes co-development on customer projects. Given this, your presentation is
intended not only to gauge your general data science proficiency, but also considers your
presentation and customer support skills. In this role effective communication is critical.

For this assessment you will prepare a solution and a presentation for the “customer”. In the
presentation, one or more Dataiku personnel will play the role of the customer.

You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
● The technical quality of the solution presented
● Your conceptual understanding of common data science topics
● The effectiveness of the presentation
● The presentation skills demonstrated
● Your answers to the customer’s questions

The presentation should be prepared to be roughly 20 minutes with an additional 20 minutes for
questions and discussion of the solution. You may present your slides in any fashion you deem
fit and should expect to explain your methods and results in a manner such that a non-technical
audience would understand. You should assume that the customer audience may range from
expert to novice in terms of data science, so the presentation should be geared towards a
general audience with enough detail to satisfy experts and also general enough to clearly
explain to the novice. You should be prepared to discuss any technical details, subjective
choices, and assumptions you made in the assessment.

Remember, the goal of the exercise is not to necessarily solve the problem completely, but
rather to illustrate a thought process, thoroughly explain an approach, and discuss and critique
the methodology used to answer the research question of interest in a collaborative setting.
